User Interface: Decide whether you want a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI) for your application. For a CLI, you can use libraries like argparse or click, and for a GUI, you can use tkinter, PyQt, or wxPython.

Data Storage: Decide how you will store the to-do list data. You can use a simple text file, a database like SQLite, or even an in-memory data structure depending on your needs.

Functionality: Implement basic functionality such as adding tasks, removing tasks, marking tasks as completed, displaying tasks, and saving tasks to the storage.

Optional Features: Consider adding features like task priorities, due dates, categories, or reminders to enhance the usability of your application.

Testing and Refinement: Test your application thoroughly to ensure it works as expected. Refine the user interface and functionality based on feedback and testing.
